Documentation and Style Guide
=============================

This page serves as a guide on how to add to the documentation for
developers.
If you are using, :code:`gnss_lib_py`, documentation is hosted
:ref:`here <mainpage>`.
If you are looking for functional level reference documentation, check
the :ref:`reference page <reference>`.
For tutorials on how to use :code:`gnss_lib_py`, refer to the
:ref:`tutorials page <tutorials>`.

We use `numpy docstrings
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__
for all documentation within this package. You can see some example
numpy docstrings `here <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy>`__.
In addition to class and function docstrings, any code
whose behaviour or purpose is not obvious, should be independently
commented.

Additional documentation guidelines
-----------------------------------

Referring textbooks or papers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To reference textbooks/papers in the docstrings, create a new section
titled References and include the reference as shown below in the
docstring. (Remove the block comment flag when inserting in already
written docstrings)

.. code-block:: python

    """
    References
    ----------
    .. [1] Fu, Guoyu Michael, Mohammed Khider, and Frank van Diggelen.

        Satellite Division of The Institute of Navigation (ION GNSS+
        2020). 2020.
    """

Parameter/Return Types
++++++++++++++++++++++

Following the numpy docstring formatting, the type of all parameters and
returns should be indicated. Common parameter/return types include the
following:

    * :code:`bool`
    * :code:`int`
    * :code:`float`
    * :code:`list` (include shape in the description)
    * :code:`dict` (include key type and value type in description)
    * :code:`np.ndarray` (include shape in the description). Where possible,
      single axis arrays should be rows and time should be across
      the columns
    * :code:`pd.DataFrame`
    * :code:`gnss_lib_py.parsers.NavData`

PEP 8 Style Guide
-----------------
We also follow the `PEP 8 Python Style Guide
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.
Highlights from PEP 8 include:

    * Class names should be in CamelCase
    * Function names should be in snake_case (lowercase with words
      separated by underscores)
    * Variable names are also in snake_case (lowercase with words
      separated by underscores)
    * Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all
      capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples
      include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL
    * mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the
      prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards
      compatibility
    * Line lengths should generally be limited to 72 characters
    * Variable and class names should be readable and follow the general
      convention of :code:`generalcategory_subcategory`, eg.
      :code:`meas_gnss` and :code:`meas_lidar`

File Header
-----------
You should begin with formatting similar to the example below following
the PEP 8 style guide for
`imports <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`__ and
author and date inclusions
(`dunders <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#module-level-dunder-names>`__).

.. code-block:: python

   """ Short description of the file contents.

   Lengthier description of the file contents that may span across
   multiple lines if necessary. All descriptions should start with a
   capital letter and end with a period. There should also be a
   blank line before the close of the docstring.

   """

   __authors__ = "Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname"
   __date__ = "DD Mmm YYYY"

   import os # import statements from the standard Python library
   import sys

   import numpy as np # a blank line and then third-party imports
   import scipy as sp

   import gnss_lib_py.utils.constants as consts # a blank line then gnss_lib_py imports

Citations
---------
Citations should be added on a function by function basis.

If a function is built on the implementation from another repository,
include the license and attribution as required by the original author.

Miscellaneous Style Notes
-------------------------
    * Vectors (lists, np.ndarrays, etc.) for a single time instance
      should be column vectors.
    * Collections of vectors should be 2D structures with each column
      representing the value of the vector for a particular time. In
      this convention, time varies across columns while physical
      quantities vary across rows.
    * Assert errors and tell the user what caused that particular error.
      For example, if a column vector is passed instead of a row vector,
      the assertion error message should say that a row vector was
      expected. We maintain functions in :code:`utils/*` that might be
      useful for performing such checks. Please check if an existing
      function performs the desired task before adding new functions.
    * Write units in brackets in comments and docstrings. For example,
      [m].


Adding to Documentation Pages
-----------------------------

If you find that documentation added to the code is not enough for your
intended use, you can add a page to the Sphinx documentation.

Use the `RST Cheat Sheet
<https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/cheatsheet/>`__ from the Sphinx
documentation for any syntax queries.

Building Documentation
----------------------

If you changed any directory names in the repository:

    * update :code:`docs/conf.py` to reflect correct directory names
    * update the helper tool :code:`build_docs.sh`
    * search the entire package files to check that all references to the
      directory have been changed

If you wish to add python dependencies:

    * add the new dependency to the poetry dependency list with
      :code:`poetry add package=version` or if the dependency is a
      development tool :code:`poetry add --dev package=version`

If you wish to remove python dependencies, use :code:`poetry remove package`.

If you're using :code:`poetry`, after the above, you can run the helper
tool from the main directory that will automatically rebuild references
and build a local HTML copy of the documentation:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ./build_docs.sh

After building the html, you can open :code:`docs/build/html/index.html` in
a browser to view your local copy.

If you encounter errors while using the :code:`build_docs.sh` tool, refer
to previously documented solutions in the
:ref:`troubleshooting page <build_errors>`.
