To report a bug, please submit an issue on

Feature requests and feedback
-----------------------------

The best way to   send feedback is to file an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Stanford-NavLab/gnss_lib_py/issues>`__.

If you are proposing a feature:

    * Explain in detail the intended feature, its purpose and how it
      would work.
    * Keep the scope as narrow as possible, which will make it easier to
      implement.
    * This is a volunteer driven project and most contributions are a
      result of other research projects. If you implement your requested
      feature and submit a pull request, we will incorporate it.
