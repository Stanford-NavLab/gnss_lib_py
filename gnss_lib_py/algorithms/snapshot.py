    """Runs weighted least squares across each timestep.

    Runs weighted least squares across each timestep and adds a new
    row for the receiver's position and clock bias.

    The option for only_bias allows the user to only calculate the clock
    bias if the receiver position is already known. Only the bias term

    Parameters
    ----------
    measurements : gnss_lib_py.parsers.navdata.NavData
        Instance of the NavData class
    weight_type : string
        Must either be None or the name of a row in measurements
    only_bias : bool
        If True, then only the receiver clock bias is estimated.
        Otherwise, both position and clock bias are estimated.
    tol : float
        Tolerance used for the convergence check.
    max_count : int
        Number of maximum iterations before process is aborted and
        solution returned.
