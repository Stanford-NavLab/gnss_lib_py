gnss_lib_py
===========

`gnss_lib_py` is a modular Python tool for parsing, analyzing, and
visualizing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data and state
estimates.
It also provides an intuitive and modular framework allowing users to
quickly prototype, implement, and visualize GNSS algorithms.
`gnss_lib_py` is modular in the sense that multiple types of
algorithms can be easily exchanged for each other and extendable in
facilitating user-specific extensions of existing implementations.

`gnss_lib_py` contains parsers for common file types used for
storing GNSS measurements, benchmark algorithms for processing
measurements into state estimates and visualization tools for measurements
and state estimates.
The modularity of `gnss_lib_py` is made possibly by the unifying
`NavData` class, which contains methods to add, remove and modify
numeric and string data consistently.
We provide standard row names for `NavData` elements on the
[reference page](https://gnss-lib-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/reference.html).
These names ensure cross compatability between different datasets and
algorithms.

```
In the directory organization above:

  * The `algorithms` directory contains localization algorithms that
    work by passing in a `NavData` class. Currently, the following
    algorithms are implemented in the `algorithms`:

      * Weighted Least Squares
      * Extended Kalman Filter
      * Calculating pseudorange residuals
      * Calculating multi-GNSS satellite PVT information
  * The data parsers in the `parsers` directory allow for either loading
    GNSS data into `gnss_lib_py`'s unifying `NavData` class or parsing
    precise ephemerides data.
    Currently, the following datasets and types are supported:

      * [2021 Google Android Derived Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-smartphone-decimeter-challenge)
      * [2022 Google Android Derived Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/smartphone-decimeter-2022)
      * [Precise Ephemeris Data](https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/GNSS/gnss_mgex.html)

  * The `utils` directory contains utilities used to handle
    GNSS measurements, time conversions, visualizations, satellite
    simulation, file operations, etc.
